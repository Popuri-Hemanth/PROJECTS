How do we overcome the situation of fatigue in an environment such as transportation or health, where
the well beings translate into safety and performance.Fatigue is a continually increasing issue across
various industries and significantly affects decision-making productivity and general health. This
project proposes an integrative system for preventing fatigue and identifying tracking and mitigating
fatigue-related risks in real time. We are looking to create an innovative solution that banks on
technology to increase the level of awareness of fatigue so that the personal as well as automobile
industrial outcomes of such are improved.

The proposed solution to address driver fatigue and drowsiness is an advanced fatigue prevention
system that offers a proactive, real-time approach to improving road safety.It uses a pulse meter
to continuously track the driver’s heart rate.Camera monitors the driver’s eye movements to detect
signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure, frequent blinking .When drowsiness is detected
through a combination of heart rate and eye movement data, the system sends this information to the
vehicle’s Engine Control Unit (ECU).The ECU then activates a multi-level warning system that alerts
the driver via a visual display, sound alarm, and flashing parking lights.If the driver fails to respond,
the system automatically slows the car down to a safe speed of 5 km/sec,ensuring the vehicle remains
under control without abrupt or dangerous movements.The system is designed to be user-friendly,
with optimized human-computer interaction (HCI).It has undergone usability testing to ensure the
interface is simple, efficient, and easy to use. The software is intuitive, allowing drivers to understand
and respond to alerts quickly.By combining data from both the heart rate monitor and the eye-tracking
camera, the system accurately detects drowsiness in real-time and intervenes.This innovative solution
effectively reduces the risk of accidents related to driver fatigue.
